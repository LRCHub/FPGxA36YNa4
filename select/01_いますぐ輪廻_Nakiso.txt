Retry now, we can't get together this run either
Promise me, if you lie, you’ll stick a needle in your eye
We're sure to meet in the next life, right?
Retry now, we can't get together this run either
Throw everything away, poi

Farewell, I’ll be reborn
This life is way too depressing
May your ring dissappear without a trace
Let it all vanish, alright
After all, once we're rеborn again
Brought together evеry cycle and reunited
Then 'til the universe blows up

I'll fall in love with you again and again
I'll fall in love with you again and again
I'll be selfish every time
I'll fall in love with you again and again
I'm sorry, "Metamorphosis"

Retry now, we can’t get together this run either
Promise me, if you lie, you’ll stick a needle in your eye
We're sure to meet in the next life, right?
Retry now, we can’t get together this run either
Throw everything away, poi

So, I need you to be born anew
This mistake of a life is so depressing
I'll be the one who's by your side, okay?
Fate, kneel before me

[Instrumental break]

Retry now, we can't get together this run either
Retry now, I’m not getting rewarded this run, huh?
Throw everything away

Die now!
The fanfare echoes
Correct, congratulations
You shall be saved at last
Let's meet again in the next life
Retry now, suffer for a little while
We're twin flames, got it?
Hurry

Now, become one with me
Come, purify your soul, harmonize with death
Pretty please, turn into light
Throw everything away, poi
